🔹 Scenario 1: Multilinear Regression

Dataset (Kaggle – Public) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

In this scenario, Multilinear Regression is used to predict student academic performance based on multiple academic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. The Students Performance in Exams dataset is preprocessed by encoding categorical variables such as parental education level and test preparation course. The target variable, Final Exam Score, is calculated as the average of math, reading, and writing scores. Features such as study hours, attendance percentage, parental education, test preparation, and sleep hours are used to train the model. The dataset is scaled, split into training and testing sets, and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score. Model optimization is performed using feature elimination, Ridge regression, and Lasso regression, and results are visualized using predicted vs actual plots, coefficient comparison, and residual distribution plots.

🔹 Scenario 2: Polynomial Regression

In this scenario, Polynomial Regression is applied to model the non-linear relationship between engine horsepower and vehicle fuel efficiency using the Auto MPG dataset. The target variable is Miles Per Gallon (MPG), and horsepower is selected as the independent feature. Missing values are handled, and polynomial features of degrees 2, 3, and 4 are generated to capture non-linear trends. The data is scaled and split into training and testing sets before training polynomial regression models for each degree. Model performance is evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and R² score, and results are compared across different polynomial degrees. Ridge regression is applied to control overfitting, and visualizations are used to demonstrate polynomial curve fitting, training vs testing error comparison, and underfitting and overfitting behavior.
